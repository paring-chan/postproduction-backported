# Create 6.x.x backport for 0.5.1.j

Bring new features from Create 6 to Create 0.5.1.j!

## DISCLAIMER

Use at your own risk. This mod modifies Create's built-in registry for add contents(to make world migration to Create 6 possible), and some of the features can be unstable and not tested well. I recommend you to make a backup of your world before adding this mod.

## NOT PLANNED THINGS

This is intended. Do *NOT* report these issues below!

- Ponder is missing
- Port for version(s) other than Minecraft 1.20.1, Create 0.5.1.j

## License

This project is a simple backport of Create. This project's code is from the [original Create source code](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create). I'm not owning the contents of the mod.
